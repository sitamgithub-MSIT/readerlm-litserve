# ReaderLM LitServe

[![Open In Studio](https://pl-bolts-doc-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/app-2/studio-badge.svg)](https://lightning.ai/sitammeur/studios/readerlm-litserve)

[Jina.ai](https://jina.ai/) has introduced [Reader-LM](https://huggingface.co/collections/jinaai/jina-reader-lm-670628bfe0d782685cb53416), specialized small language models inspired by "Jina Reader" designed for converting raw, noisy HTML from the open web into clean markdown. The resulting reader-lm models outperform larger LLMs in this specific task, offering a cost-effective and multilingual solution. This project demonstrates the use of the Reader-LM model for converting HTML content to Markdown content served using LitServe, an easy-to-use, flexible serving engine for AI models built on FastAPI.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `server.py`: The file containing the main code for the web server.
- `client.py`: The file containing the code for client-side requests.
- `LICENSE`: The license file for the project.
- `README.md`: The README file that contains information about the project.
- `assets`: The folder containing screenshots for working on the application.
- `.gitignore`: The file containing the list of files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## Tech Stack

- Python (for the programming language)
- PyTorch (for the deep learning framework)
- Hugging Face Transformers Library (for the model)
- LitServe (for the serving engine)

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Run the server: `python server.py`
2. Upon running the server successfully, you will see uvicorn running on port 8000.
3. Open a new terminal window.
4. Run the client: `python client.py`

Now, you can see the output of the model based on the HTML content. The model will convert the HTML content to Markdown content.

## Usage

The project can be used to serve the Reader-LM model using LitServe. Here, the model is used to convert HTML content to Markdown content. This suggests potential applications in web scraping, content repurposing, and accessibility improvements.
